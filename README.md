# AffinityTracker

A chrome extension that tracks User Affinity for specified product keywords

I was tasked with building this chrome extention as a challenge test for a job interview.

User Affinity basically tracks the likelyhood that the users is interested in a specified product category, namely mens, womens, lifestyle, bueaty and home. It is tracked by recording points everytime the user visists a product page for an item of one of these categories or adds an item to the cart. Affinity points will increase by 1 point for visiting a product page and by 3 points for adding an item to the cart.

The next thing this extention will do is sort the contents on a page in accordance with the users' affinity for these categories. So if a users is spending a lot of time browsing through mens and lifestyle products, these elements should appear at the top of the page.

This extention will only work on one particular web site.
